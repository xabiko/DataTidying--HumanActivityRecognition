#Getting and cleaning data Course Project
This project contains a script that applies certain transformations to [this dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

##Content:
1. run_analysis.R : refer to CodeBook for setup and description.
2. CodeBook.md : setup and description.
3. README.md

##Required libraries:
* dplyr_0.4.3

##Assumptions:
* It is assumed that everyone who tests the script for evaluation purposes has downloaded [this dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), and has unzipped it completely.
* It is assumed that the unzipped data keeps the same file-structure as the zipped data, and that the current working directory is set to ".../UCI HAR Dataset/"
